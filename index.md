We explore how to use data as a creative material. Our lab draws from the traditions of human-computer interaction, design, data science, data visualization, and critical computing.  

#### Our Approach to Data

- We use **all of our senses** — sight, smell, touch, taste, and especially sound — to engage with data in new ways.  
- We consider how we can encounter different kinds of data (from the personal to the environmental to the technological) in **social contexts**.  
- We design **new technologies and experiences** for encouraging reflection, experimentation, and storytelling around data.  
- We value the **experiences** that emerge from working with data as much as the artifacts that we create from data.
