### Exploring Language Through a Generative Mood Tracker
by *Liuyi Lyu*

How do we translate the intangible experience of mood into something we can hear and reflect upon? This generative mood tracking app attempts to discover the sonic representability of emotional language—the extent to which abstract feelings can be heard—exploring how certain concepts can be better, or worse, sonically represented than others. Why does "rain" sounds so distinctly through AI generation while "solitude" remains acoustically elusive? This tension between the sonically obvious and the sonically obscure reveals the hidden hierarchies within our emotional vocabularies.

The app invites users to log their momentary mood once per day within a randomly generated one-hour window, documenting their emotional state through structured prompts designed for sonic generation. Their written reflections are transformed into AI-generated sounds using various musical and ambient labels, but these sounds remain unheard until the next day's entry is complete. This gap in time allows the generated sound to be encountered fresh, without the pressure of matching preconceived sonic expectations.

### Strengthening Personal Relationships To Sound With The Daily Sonification Journal
by *Catelyn Clevenger*

Sonic reflection is a component of sonic thinking that deepens personal connections between sound and memory.  While various tools for visual and tactile reflection exist, such as journaling and scrapbooking, sonic reflection tools often serve to supplement these methods, if implemented at all.  The Daily Sonification web app is a platform designed to cultivate sonic reflection habits by guiding users to construct personalized soundscapes based on their daily experiences.  The web app incorporates progression features, allowing users to have more control over their resulting sonifications over time.  Users can relisten to their sonifications in a similar way to how they might reread a journal entry.  Inspirations for this project include popular music games, such as "Incredibox" and "My Singing Monsters," that lower the barriers to sound design.

### Extending Sound Beyond the Ear
by *Deo Rubangakene*

Throughout the summer and the fall, I was intrigued and passionately exploring the idea of how we can interact with sound as a physical tangible space or object. Thinking of this through the design of workshops, lesson plans, that build self sonic portraits to listening benches. Sound is an intimate interaction that I find can be instrumental to bringing people together and building deeper connections in a world that thrives on authentic community. There is bigger and more sound than music. How do we perceive  silence, how do we develop habits and individual rituals with sound. My project seeks to answer these questions and push beyond the rigid hallmarks of sound as survillences and signaling but how, where and when to actively  engage with sound.
